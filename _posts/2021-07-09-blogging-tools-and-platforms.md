I've tried many blogging tools and platforms, many jekyll themes and much more.
But as you are seeing I've stuck with this simple Jekyll theme called console.

I have tried the theme chirpy, but I always had problems with it.
I tried using a blogging platform called [bearblog](https://bearblog.dev) but it just wasn't for me.

I feel like using too complicated software and JavaScript is just bloat and complication, plus my programming skills are shit. [This post](https://herman.bearblog.dev/motherfucking-blog/) by Herman, creator of bearblog, summorazes it.
Just stick to simple and clean blogs.

EDIT (13th July 2021)
I've switched back to the chirpy theme because the theme im currently using isn't being maintained anymore and I rethinked it and I think chirpy is better because it has more features but it still isn't bloat.
